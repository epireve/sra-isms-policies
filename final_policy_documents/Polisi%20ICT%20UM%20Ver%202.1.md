## <span id="page-3-1"></span>**Application of UM ICT Policy**

Every procedure and regulation is for a specific group of people, depending on their roles and responsibilities. All UM community members must read, understand, adhere to the instructions and apply them consistently. The responsibilities stated in the ICT Policy can also be applied to the role of the organization and the individual. Documents which supports the achievements of these roles are work process documents like work instructions, procedures, regulations, guidelines, work schedules, reports and others. Where appropriate and necessary, work process documents must be created based on existing policies.
