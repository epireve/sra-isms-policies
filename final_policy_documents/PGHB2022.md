#### **HISTORY OF THE FACULTY**

<span id="page-6-0"></span>The provision of computer facilities and services at the Universiti Malaya (UM) began in mid-1967, soon after the Computer Centre was officially formed in 1965. This also made the university one of the pioneers in computer usage in Malaysia. In December 1969, the Computer Centre took on an additional role of teaching and research of computer science and information technology. The Computer Centre Board was formed, comprising the Vice Chancellor (as Chairman), the Director of Computer Centre (as Secretary), and a representative from each Faculty, Institute, Centre of the University, and from the University Senate.

In 1974, the Diploma in Computer Science postgraduate programme was introduced. From its inception in the 1974/75 session to the 1999/2001 session, a total of 304 students had been awarded the Diploma.

The Master of Computer Science (M. Comp. Sc.) and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) were two higher degree research programmes approved by the Senate and had been administered by the Computer Centre since 1985. In addition, the Computer Centre offered a 4-year Bachelor of Computer Science programme. The first undergraduate enrollment for 1990/91 session was 50 students.

In April 1993, the University Senate agreed to the formation of the Computer Centre Study Board. The Board proposed the establishment of a faculty to be called the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT). The existing Computer Centre was to be annulled and replaced by a Computer Services Division which was placed under the Chancellery.

On September 22 1994, the Universiti Malaya Council agreed to the formation of the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology (FCSIT), and the Computer Services Division. A sum of RM 4.2 million was obtained from the Ministry of Education under the 6th Malaysia Plan to put up a new building for the faculty, with the necessary infrastructure for teaching, learning and research. The building was officially declared open by the then Minister of Education, Datuk Seri Najib Tun Abdul Razak on 26 September 1996.

The Bachelor of Information Technology programme started in the 1996/97 academic session, with an initial intake of 50 students. In 1997, the Faculty established four departments, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Information and Library Science, and, Computer Systems and Technology.

To accommodate an increased student population, an additional building was built in 1997- 98 which was officially opened by Dato' Dr. Fong Chan Onn, the then Deputy Minister of Education on 21 September 1998. Since its establishment, the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology has been led by a number of distinguished persons. The following have served as Directors/Deans:

#### **PREFACE**

In the process of completing a postgraduate programme and being awarded the degree by the Universiti Malaya, a candidate may be required to submit a research report or dissertation or thesis, depending on the requirements of the specific programme.

The terms "research report", "dissertation" and "thesis" are defined as follows:

- Research Report refers to the documentation of research prepared and submitted by the candidate for the award of a Master's degree by Coursework or Master's Degree by Clinical which may include research paper, research project, project paper, project report and research outcome concerned known by whatsoever name;
- Dissertation refers to the documentation of the original research prepared and submitted by the candidate for the award of a Master's degree by Research, and Master's Degree by Mixed Mode as well as Doctoral degree by Coursework and Doctoral degree by Clinical;
- Thesis refers to the documentation of the original research prepared and submitted by the candidate for the award of a Doctoral degree by Research and Doctoral degree by Mixed Mode.

This guideline will assist the candidates to meet the minimum format requirements set by the University to complete the final form of a research report, dissertation or thesis. However, the format may differ in each individual Academy/Faculty/Institute/Centre with its own additional requirements. In this guideline, the term 'faculty' will be used to refer to Academy/Faculty/Institute/Centre.

#### **CHAPTER 1: FORMAT OF WRITING**

A research report, dissertation or thesis can be written in one of the following formats:

- Conventional format;
- Article style format;
- Format of published papers (this option is only available for Doctoral programme by research candidates)

These formats serve as a generic guideline for the postgraduate candidates in writing a research report, dissertation or thesis. Minor variation of the format as recommended by the faculty is allowed. Candidates are advised to discuss with their supervisors to determine which format is best suited for the nature of their research work.

#### **1.1 Conventional Format**

The conventional format follows the traditional monograph structure (Table 1.1). This is the most common form of research report/dissertation/thesis used by the candidates.

#### **Table 1.1: The general structure that follows the conventional format**

#### **1.2 Article Style Format**

Apart from the conventional style of writing, a research report/dissertation/thesis can also be presented in the chapters that are in the format of journal article (Table 1.2). The number of chapters to be included is at the discretion of the author, depending on the suitability of the chapters in answering the research questions.

This format is also applicable to candidates of Doctoral Degree by Research using **Concurrent or Prospective Publication**. The candidate submits a thesis/conspectus<sup>1</sup> which incorporates publications that may have multiple authors since registration. The candidate may also present a portfolio of interconnected, published research papers or articles encapsulated in a coherent thesis/conspectus, demonstrating overall an original contribution to knowledge. Such publications may include papers, chapters, monographs, books, scholarly editions of a text, technical reports, creative work in relevant areas, or other artefacts. The thesis (with the publications or equivalent works) must meet the criteria and outcomes established for a doctoral award and assessed through a *viva voce*.

The article style format should not be confused with the format for thesis by retrospective or prior publication. Similar to the conventional format, a research report/dissertation/thesis in the article style format should be written extensively to elucidate the different aspects of the research work in great details.

The main body of a research report/dissertation/thesis in the article style format should contain the following chapters:

#### **(a) General Introduction**

The General Introduction gives an overview of the research by outlining the objectives, novelty as well as the research questions addressed. This chapter should also explain the correlation among the articles/chapters.

#### **(b) Literature Review**

The Literature Review provides extensive background information on past studies and current knowledge pertaining to the research topic.

#### **(c) Article 1, Article 2, Article 3 or more**

Each article should address a specific research objective or a related topic of the study. Each article forms a separate chapter and must be written in a cohesive manner with a logical and coordinated progression from one article/chapter to the other. The article/chapter should consist of its own sections on Introduction, brief Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion and Conclusion.

#### **(d) Conclusion and Recommendation**

The Conclusion chapter summarizes the findings in all articles and suggests the future direction for research.

The format specifications of the research report/dissertation/thesis must conform to the general research report /dissertation/thesis requirements as outlined in Chapter 2.

<sup>1</sup> A critical review which locates the artefact/s within a coherent theoretical framework and field/s of study.

#### **Table 1.2: The general structure that follows the article style format**

*Note: \*Article is written with a specific title which normally refers to the research done Supplementary* List of Publications and Papers Presented Appendices Co-authors Consent

#### **1.3 Format of Published Papers**

The University also permits the presentation of thesis for the programme of Doctoral Degree by Research i.e. Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in the format of published and/or submitted papers, where such papers have been published or accepted by high impact journals (e.g. journals indexed by Web of Science), monographs, books, research-based chapters in books, electronic publications, creative works, artefacts in the field before or during the period of candidature (Table 1.3).

Papers submitted as a PhD thesis must be based on a particular theme or focus and form a cohesive research write up. The quality of a thesis by published papers should be in accordance with PhD-level research and must meet the criteria and outcomes established for a doctoral award. The following aspects should be taken into consideration before opting for this format of writing:

#### **(a) Type of Publications**

The thesis may comprise published papers and/or manuscripts accepted for publication by high impact journals (e.g. journals indexed by Web of Science), monographs, books, research-based chapters in books, electronic publications, creative works, artefacts in the field which have not been used to obtain other awards or deemed a part of those awards.

#### **(b) Number of Publications**

For candidates under the programme of **Doctoral Degree by Retrospective or Prior Publication**, the minimum number of publications or productions is at least five (5) and these works must be those published retrospectively within a period not exceeding 10 years from the date of application. However, in some disciplines a larger number of papers is required to meet the expectations of scope and quality in accordance with PhD-level research.

#### **(c) Authorship**

Where the papers have more than one author, the candidate must be the first author or creator of five (5) of the published works or productions submitted with the contributions of others clearly defined.

#### **(d) Co-authors Consent**

Candidates must obtain the consent from other co-authors for all papers and/or manuscripts and/or publications or production used as part of their PhD thesis. The consent can be in the form of a verification from the journal publisher or letter or email communication with the co-authors.

#### **(e) Structure of Thesis**

The thesis in the format of published papers shall consist of the following:

- (i) An **abstract**, which summarises the most important findings presented in each published paper or accepted manuscript or production. It should indicate how the included works are thematically linked or tied to a particular research framework and how, when considered together, they contribute significantly to knowledge in the discipline.
- (ii) The **Introduction** chapter should include the following:
	- description of research problem investigated;
	- objectives of the study;
	- list of publications and/or accepted manuscripts or production;
	- the account of research progress linking the publications. The account of research progress must link together the various papers or production submitted as part of the thesis so that the reader can understand the logic behind the progression of the research programme.
- (iii) The **Literature Review** chapter must contain, in accordance with the relevant discipline's norms, a critical review of relevant literature, identify the knowledge gaps and the relationship of the literature to the area of research.
- (iv) The **Methodology** chapter (where applicable).
- (v) The core chapter of the thesis consist of the published papers or accepted manuscripts or production in their **original publication format** and should NOT be retyped or reformatted. They must be presented coherently in the thesis according to the requirement of the University of Malaya Doctoral Degree Regulations (latest version), including any accompanying declarations. The following must be indicated for any jointly written paper:
	- Acknowledgment of co-authors and verification of originality.
	- A clear statement of the contribution made by each author in any joint published work or production. For example, a statement of contribution from a 3-author academic research publication is as follows:

Tang, J.M.Y., Adli, D.S.H., & Belabut, D. (2011). Histological development of selected neural structures of Dark-sided Chorus Frog,

Microhyla heymonsi (Amphibia: Anura). *Malaysian Journal of Science*, *29*(1), 11-18.

Tang, J.M.Y. participated in all experiments, coordinated the data analysis and contributed to the writing of the manuscript. Adli, D.S.H. supervised the development of work and edited the manuscript. Belabut, D. gave technical support and conceptual advice, and helped in datainterpretation.

- (vi) The **Discussion** chapter explains the cumulative effect of the papers, the significance of the findings and the knowledge claimed in the thesis.
- (vii) The **Conclusion** summarizes the findings in all published works or production and suggests the future direction for research.
- (viii) The **References** chapter lists all works and sources that are cited in the Introduction, Literature Review and Conclusion chapters.

In general, the examination process for theses in the format of published papers is similar to that of conventional theses. However the aspects of thesis being evaluated by the examiners may slightly differ.

Candidates under the programme of **Doctoral Degree by Retrospective or Prior Publication** are required to refer to the *Guidelines for Admission To The Universiti Malaya Doctoral Degree By Research Programme Via Retrospective or Prior Publication* (latest version) for further details.

#### **[TITLE OF RESEARCH REPORT/DISSERTATION/THESIS]**

#### **ABSTRACT**

The purpose of this aesthetic evaluation is two-fold. First, I examine J.R.R. Tolkien's literary illustration of space, place, and atmosphere in a series of locations across Middle-earth. I focus on the aesthetic facets of the physical environments, the possible aesthetic experiences generated from the visual layers of landscapes and atmospheres, and finally, the philosophical implications obtained through the moments of reflection in those locations. Second, I investigate the possibility of considering Tolkien's depiction of space, place, and atmosphere as literary artifacts and the construction of the whole Middle-earth as an act of artistic creation. The theoretical framework of this doctoral research is formulated based on the combination of seven critical criteria consisting of formalism, framing, historical/biographical information, imagination, the dialectical, engagement, and aesthetic creation theory taken from environmental aesthetics and art philosophy. These critical terms are tools at hand in aesthetically determined forms of evaluation and appreciation, which allows assessing the qualitative—literary—landscapes from multidisciplinary views to interpret their aesthetic and philosophical significance. Results demonstrate that Middle-earth could beobserved as an aesthetico-cultural tapestry on which Tolkien materialized his artistic, creative, moral, social, and environmental concerns regarding the grave era in which he lived. He accomplished this task through the depiction of perceptual aesthetic dimensions of the literary environments. Therefore, Middle-earth could stand as more than a mere background of *The Lord of the Rings;* thus, the shaping of this imagined realm can be identified as an act of art creation. Further, the aesthetic decoration and juxtaposition of the physical environments and artifactual objects in Middle-earth make them eligible to be viewed as literary artifacts. The findings of this research can crucially contribute to our understanding of J.R.R. Tolkien as a literary world-builder who externally depicted the landscapes of Middle-earth with aesthetic features and internally elevated them with philosophical dimensions to convey his moral, philosophical, artistic, and environmental messages. The results could also assist scholars in arts and humanities in illuminating how the representation of imagined geography could be utilized as a powerful aesthetic tool to demonstrate thought-provoking aestheticphilosophical spaces of contemplation.

There is no restriction on the total number of chapters in a research report/dissertation/thesis. The number of chapters differs according to the field of study conducted by the candidate whether it is science-based or social science-based. However the content of the chapters may differ according to the candidate's research or conventions of individual faculty.

Generally, a research report/dissertation/thesis will have the following basic structure:

- **INTRODUCTION**
- **LITERATURE REVIEW**
- **METHODOLOGY**
- **RESULTS**
- **DISCUSSION**
- **CONCLUSION**
- **REFERENCES**

Items in the structure are divided into separate chapters and the descriptions of these chapters are as follows:

#### **2.2.1 Introduction**

This chapter contains the introduction to the issues in which the research is concerned with, the aims and objectives of the study, and the scope or outline of the research approach as well as the structure of the research report/dissertation/thesis.

#### **2.2.2 Literature Review**

A literature review is a description of the literature relevant to a particular field or topic of study. It consists of a critically written and comprehensive account of the published works on a topic by accredited scholars and researchers. A critical literature review is a critical assessment of the relevant literature. It is directly related to the research, providing information on theories, models, materials and techniques used in the research. The literature review should be comprehensive and include recent publications which are relevant to the research.

#### **2.2.3 Methodology**

This chapter describes and explains the materials as well as the research methodology used in the study. The sub-topics for this chapter include the key research questions, the research design, and the research procedures adopted. It may also, where appropriate, indicate sampling methods, research instruments and statistical methods employed. The purpose of this is to inform the reader on the methods used to collect the data and generate the findings reported.

#### **2.2.4 Results**

This chapter explains the results which are commonly presented in the form of text, figures and tables, complete with data analysis.

#### **2.2.5 Discussion**

This chapter contains the interpretation of the results. The findings of the research should be compared and contrasted with those of previous studies presented in the literature review. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the findings and the outcomes of the research in relation to the results that have been obtained.

#### **2.2.6 Conclusion**

In this chapter, the findings are summarized and their implications discussed. This section may include suggestions for future work.

#### **2.2.7 References**

All works or studies referred to in the research report/dissertation/thesis in the form of quotations or citations must be included in the references.

The references should be written consistently in the American Psychological Association (APA) format or in another format approved by the faculty. Each reference should be written in single spacing format and a double space should be left between references. The list of references must be arranged in alphabetical order and the entries should not be numbered. The list must also have a hanging indentation of 0.5 inch. For example:

Walmsley, Ben. (2019), *Audience Engagement in the Performing Arts: A Critical Analysis*. Springer Nature.

Wreen, Michael. (2014) "Beardsley's Aesthetics." *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, edited by Edward N. Zalta, Winter 2014, Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University.

Tillson, Victoria G. (2010) "A Nearly Invisible City: Rome in Alberto Moravia's 1950s fiction." *Annali d'Italianistica, 28*: 237-256.

Reference citations in text require the following information:

- last name of the author or as specified in the UM Library APA Formatting and Style Guide (latest edition),
- the year of publication,
- the page number for the reference (direct quotes only).

For summaries or paraphrases, the last name of the author and the year of publication must be included for the in-text reference. For examples:

Kingston and Parker (2012) found the biggest challenges in classroom to be ….

The biggest challenges in classroom were …. (Kingston & Parker, 2012).

For direct quotations (which refers to when the exact words of another author are copied), the last name of the author, the year of publication as well as the page number for the reference must be included for the in-text reference. The quotation has to be enclosed in quotation marks. For examples:

In *Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth* (1980), Christopher writes that his father illustrated mallorn trees based on familiar Primary World species.

Gollum enter the damned land of Sauron. Tolkien describes the scenery from the eyes of the hobbits and writes, "slowly and painfully they clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows" (*The Lord of the Rings*, 917).

If the quoted citation contains more than 40 words, it should be placed within a paragraph of its own with a 0.5 inch indentation. For example:

Thacker could answer that question too when he contends that "since the early 1990s questions of space and geography have become recognized as legitimate and important topicsin many areas ofliterary and culturalstudies, and setting out the sphere of literature, if not life, by some form of map a more familiar hermeneutic strategy" (*The Idea of a Critical Literary Geography*, 57-8).<sup>91</sup> It is, therefore, fruitful to carry out an analysis of Tolkien's watercoloresque melancholic visualization of space, place, and atmosphere and observe them as Tolkien's critique of the destructive nature of modernity that parallels with contemporary environmental concerns.

Please refer to the Universiti Malaya Library APA Formatting and Style Guide. The guide can be downloaded at UM Library website [\(https://umlibguides.um.edu.my\)](https://umlibguides.um.edu.my/)

#### **2.3 Supplementary**

Specific items which were not included in the main body of the text, should be put in this Supplementary section. Typically, this section includes the following:

#### **2.3.1 List of Publications and Papers Presented**

Published works as well as papers presented at conferences, seminars, symposiums etc. pertaining to the research topic of the research report/dissertation/thesis are suggested be included in this section. The first page of the article may also be appended as reference.

#### **2.3.2 Appendices**

Appendices consist of research instruments, additional illustration of data sources, raw data and quoted citations which are too long to be placed in the text. The appendix section supports the written text of the research report/dissertation/thesis by including materials that can provide additional information. These materials include research data, tables, examples of questionnaires, maps, photos and other materials that are too long to be included in the text or are not directly required to comprehend the text can be included as appendices.

Tables and graphics that are more than two pages long are suggested to be included in the Appendix section.

Appendices are labelled as APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, etc. and they should correspond to the List of Appendices of Preliminary section.

#### **2.3.3 Co-authors Consent**

Please refer to 1.3 (d).

#### **CHAPTER 3: FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS**

#### **3.1 Paper Quality, Printing and Duplicating**

The research report/dissertation/thesis should be printed, single-sided, on high quality white A4 paper (201 × 297 mm; 80 grams). Computer pin-feed printout paper is not permitted.

The research report/dissertation/thesis, in soft cover copies, must be typed and duplicated by offset printing or good quality photocopying. All copies must be clean and neat in order to ensure easy reading.

#### **3.2 Typing and Printing Quality**

Texts in research report/dissertation/thesis should be typed on **one side** of the paper only.

They must be typed using font type **Times New Roman, font size 12** (except for tables and figures) and justified, using Microsoft Word version (latest edition) or later, or similar wordprocessing software. Those written in Arabic should use font type **Traditional Arabic in font size 16.** Words in a language that is different from the language of the research report /dissertation/thesis must be typed in *italics*. For mathematical texts, the use of [Equation](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/insert-an-equation-using-equation-editor-HP005190247.aspx) [Editor](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/insert-an-equation-using-equation-editor-HP005190247.aspx)  or [LaTeX is](http://www.latex-project.org/) advisable. Script fonts are not permitted.

Chapter titles should be typed with capital letters and centered between the left and right margins. Each chapter must begin on a new page. Chapters and subchapters should be also titled. Titles should be typed in bold without underline.

A high-quality laser or ink-jet printer should be used for the printing.

#### **3.3 Line Spacing**

The body of the text should be typed with **double spacing**. Single-spacing is only permitted in tables, long quotations, footnotes, citation and in the references.

The first sentence of a new paragraph should not start at the bottom of a page if the space available can only fit one line.

#### **3.4 Margins**

The text should have the following margins:

- Top : 2.0 cm or 0.79 inch
- Right : 2.0 cm or 0.79 inch
- Left : 4.0 cm or 1.57 inch
- Bottom : 2.0 cm or 0.79 inch

Additional guidelines regarding margin are as follows:

 Do not type more than one sentence after the bottom margin. If it is necessary to do so, it should only be for a footnote or the completion of the last sentence of the chapter, topic or sub-topic or information in a figure.

- All tables and figures must be placed within the specified margins.
- The last paragraph of the page should contain at least two sentences. If it does not, the paragraph should begin on the next page.

#### **3.5 Page Numbering**

All page numbers should be printed 1.0 cm from the bottom edge of the page and placed at the right-hand side without any punctuation (Figure 3.1).

The page numbering system must conform to the following rules:

- The page numbers should be placed at the right-hand side without any punctuation.
- Font type Times New Roman and font size 10 recommended for numbers.
- Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, …) should be used in the Preliminary section. The first page of the thesis, the title page, is an unnumbered page 'i'. Numbering begins on the secondpage with 'ii' for the Original Literary Work Declaration Form.
- Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, …) are used on the pages of the text (starting with the Introduction page) and Supplementary section.

**Figure 3.1: Placement of page number**

#### **3.6 Numbering of Chapters and Sub-chapters**

Chapters and sub-chapters must be numbered using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3 etc). Chapters are numbered CHAPTER 1, CHAPTER 2, CHAPTER 3, and so on. Subchapters are nested, but its numbering is not indented, up to a maximum of 4 levels as in the example shown below:

**CHAPTER 2: FIRST LEVEL (CHAPTER TITLE) 2.1 Level 2 (sub-title); 2.1.1 Level 3 (sub-sub-title); 2.1.1.1 Level 4 (sub-sub-sub-title)**

The use of letters in parenthesis in the main body for e.g., (a), (b), (c) is appropriate as a means of differentiating sub-topics of the same topic. However, it is not required to be listed in the Table of Contents.

If a chapter title or chapter sub-title at any level exceeds a single line, the spacing between the lines must be the same as that of the text (double-spacing). Subsequent sub-chapters beyond the fourth nesting level must be numbered using alphabets; (a), (b), (c), and so on.

#### **3.7 Footnotes**

There are differences in the use of footnotes in various disciplines. For example, footnotes are commonly used in Social Sciences research but rarely in Sciences research. However, candidates are advised to limit the use of footnotes unless they are proved necessary to the document. Footnotes are used to elaborate or provide additional information regarding matters discussed in that page.

Footnotes are recorded using Arabic numeric and numbered consecutively. Raised superscript numerals in the text refer to explanatory notes and documented sources appearing either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the end of the thesis as endnotes in a notes section. The advantage of using notes is that explanatory type of information can be presented along with source citations on the same page or place.

Footnotes should use a smaller font than the text (font size 8).

When using footnote, a number formatted in superscript is inserted following the punctuation mark in the text. Footnotes should be placed at the bottom of the page on which they appear (Figure 3.2). Please refer to the faculty for the recommended convention for writing of footnotes.

Western ideas of art, civilization, and philosophy was first discussed by Plato in *The Republic* (381 BC).<sup>93</sup>

<sup>93</sup> Gardner, Sebastian. *Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason*. Psychology Press, 1999.

**Figure 3.2: Example of footnote**

#### **3.8 Tables**

Tables are printed within the body of the text at the center of the frame and labelled according to the chapter in which they appear. Thus, for example, tables in Chapter 3 are numbered sequentially: Table 3.1, Table 3.2 and so on.

The caption should be placed **above** the table itself (Table 3.1). If the table contains a citation, the source of the reference should be included in the table caption.

| Heading | Heading |
|---------|---------|
| Text    | Text    |

If the table occupies more than one page, the continued table on the following page should indicate that it is a continuation, for example: 'Table 3.7, continued'. The header row should also be repeated.

#### **3.9 Figures**

Figures, like tables are printed within the body of the text at the center of the frame and labelled according to the chapter in which they appear. Thus, for example, figures in Chapter 3 are numbered sequentially: Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2.

Figures, unlike text or tables, contain graphs, illustrations or photographs and their labels are placed at the **bottom** of the figure rather than at the top (using the same format used for tables) (Figure 3.3).

If the figure occupies more than one page, the continued figure on the following page should indicate that it is a continuation: for example: 'Figure 3.7, continued'.

If the figure contains a citation, the source of the reference should be placed after the label.

#### **3.10 Binding**

Each copy of the research report/dissertation/thesis submitted shall be bound in one (1) volume. The thesis cover must be of A4 size (210mm x 297mm).

For the purpose of examination, research report/dissertation/thesis submitted should be **soft cover or comb** bound with the following colour (Figure 3.4):

- Research report: Navy blue
- Dissertation: Dark red or maroon
- Thesis: Dark red or maroon

For final submission prior to graduation, research report/dissertation/thesis submitted should be **hard cover** bound in rexine with the following colour (Figure 3.5):

The title of research report/dissertation/thesis, name of author, name of the University and year of submission must be printed on the front cover. The letters for the Front Cover should be printed in **gold letterings** of **font size 16, font type Arial Narrow, bold and in uppercase letters** (Figure 3.6 and 3.7).

**Figure 3.6: Formatting of the front cover of research report/dissertation/thesis**

**Figure 3.7: Example of the front cover of research report/ dissertation/thesis**

The spine of the manuscripts should show the title of research report/dissertation/thesis, name of author, year of submission and name of degree. The year of submission must be in accordance with the year when the research report/dissertation/thesis is submitted (Figure3.8 and 3.9). If the title of the research report/dissertation/thesis exceeds the space of the spine, a smaller font size can be used (i.e. font size 16 to 14) or alternatively the title can be truncated with ellipses (…) (Figure 3.10).

#### **CHAPTER 5: PLAGIARISM**

Postgraduate candidate of the Universiti Malaya are expected to produce original academic work. Plagiarism is defined as an academic fraud arising from the attitude of lying, insincerity, untrustworthiness, dishonesty and disrespect to fellow colleagues. Plagiarism happens when someone else's idea is taken without mentioning the source, and thus giving the impression that the idea is his own. This situation may occur when:

(1) one's idea, taken word for word from an article or book that has been published.

(2) The idea of a person from an article or book is taken using his own words.

(3) A person's idea is taken from discussions whether in conferences, seminars, forums, talks or informal discussions between two parties.

(4) Data, diagrams, tables, photographs or any other illustrative material derived from others is taken as if it were his own.

Postgraduate candidates are strongly advised to read the "How to Avoid Plagiarism: A Handbook for Postgraduate Students", which outlines the rules and regulations pertaining to acts of plagiarism.

The University also requires the usage of Turnitin, an online web-based plagiarism detection application to avoid plagiarism and academic dishonesty. In most cases, the similarity index percentage should be between **10% to 30%.** Please refer to your respective faculty regarding the acceptable similarity index percentage.
