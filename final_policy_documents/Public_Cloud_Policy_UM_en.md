# **PUBLIC CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE POLICY UNIVERSITI MALAYA**

# **1. BACKGROUND**

Public Cloud Computing Services offer several advantages such as cost savings, high performance, and enabling rapid service delivery. However, without proper controls, the use of these services can increase the risk of data loss and theft, unauthorized access, misuse of personal and organizational data since these computing assets and facilities are outside the organization's control.

The ICT Committee Meeting No. 1/2018 dated April 11, 2018, decided that a policy regarding the use of public cloud computing services should be established as a form of control to reduce risks to University information security.
