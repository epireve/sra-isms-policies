# **INTRODUCTION**

The UM ICT Security Policy contains rules that must be read and adhered to in the usage of UM information and communication technology (ICT) assets. This policy also states to all users at UM, their roles and responsibilities in protecting these UM ICT assets.

# **OBJECTIVES**

The UM ICT Security Policy was created to ensure that UM activities proceed smoothly and to minimize the effect of ICT incidents.

This policy is also intended to make the sharing of information relevant to the operational need of UM easier. This can only be achieved by ensuring that all ICT assets are protected.

Therefore, the main objectives of UM ICT Security are as follows:

- (a) Ensure that UM operations proceed smoothly and minimize damage or destruction;
- (b) Protect the interests of all parties that rely upon information systems from the effects of failure or weaknesses in terms of secrecy, integrity, readiness, information validity and communications; and
- (c) Prevent the misuse or theft of UM ICT Assets.

# **POLICY STATEMENT**

Security is defined as a state that is free of unmitigated threats or risks. Security enforcement is a never ending process. It involves scheduled activities that must be performed from time to time in order to ensure security as the potential threats and risks are always changing.

| REFERENCE | VERSION     | DATE                  | PAGE        |

ICT Security is a state where all transactions involving the supply or provision of ICT system based services proceeds seamlessly without any interruptions that could compromise security. ICT Security is closely related to the protection of ICT assets. ICT Security consists of four (4) components that are:

- (a) Guarding official secrets and university secrets from access by illegal entities;
- (b) Ensuring the validity and completeness of all information;
- (c) Ensuring the availability of information when required by users; and
- (d) Providing access only to legal users and legal information recipients.

The UM ICT Security Policy encompasses all forms of electronic information and is intended to protect the safety of that information as well as the availability of that information to all valid users. The main features of information security are as follows:

- (a) Secrecy Information cannot be randomly exposed or accessed without authorization;
- (b) Integrity Data and information must be accurate, complete and current. It can only be modified using allowed methods;
- (c) Non refuted Data and information sources must be from the source of origin and can not be refuted;
- (d) Validity The validity of data and information must be ensured; and
- (e) Availability Data and information must be accessible at all times.

| DKICT UM  | Version 2.0 | th February 2013<br>4 | 10<br>of 105 |

Other than that, the measures towards ensuring ICT security are based on assessments relevant to current intrinsic weaknesses in ICT assets; threats arise from those weaknesses; risks that may arise; and the appropriate preventative measures that can be taken to combat those risks.

# **SCOPE**

UM ICT assets consist of hardware, software, services, data or information as well as humans. The UM ICT Security Policy sets the following basic requirements:

- (a) Data and information should be accessed continuously, accurately, easily and validly. This is critical to allow decisions and service delivery to be made well and effectively; and
- (b) All data and information confidentiality must be protected and handled with care at all times to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information as well as to protect the interests of UM, service and the community.

In order to ensure that ICT asset security is ensured at all times, the UM ICT Security Policy encompasses protecting all forms of university information whether entered, created, destroyed, stored, generated, printed, accesses, distributed, transmitted and that has been made as a security duplicate. This will be done via the creation and enforcement of a control system and procedures in the handling of the following:

# **(a) Hardware**

This includes all assets that support the processing of information as well as UM storage facilities. For example computers, servers, communications equipment and etcetera;

| REFERENCE | VERSION     | DATE                  | PAGE         |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| DKICT UM  | Version 2.0 | th February 2013<br>4 | 11<br>of 105 |

# **(b) Software**

This includes programs, procedures and rules that are written and the relevant documentation as pertains to the computer operating systems, data center systems, network system software, or office applications that provide information processing for UM;

# **(c) Services**

This includes services or systems that support other assets in performing their functions. Examples are:

- i. Network services like LANs, WANs and so on;
- ii. Access control systems such as card access systems; and
- iii. Support services such as electrical facilities, air-conditioners, fire control systems and others.

# **(d) Data and Information**

This includes information on paper or electronic messages that contain information that is used to achieve that mission and objective of UM. For example, documentation systems, operating procedures, UM records, customer profiles, data centers and data files, archived information and others;

# **(e) Humans**

Individuals who have the knowledge and ability to perform the daily UM job scope to achieve the mission and objective of the agency. These individuals are assets based on the tasks and functions that are performed; and

# **(f) Computer and Communication Premises**

All facilities and premises that are used to house items **(a)** - **(e)** above.

| REFERENCE | VERSION     | DATE                  | PAGE         |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| DKICT UM  | Version 2.0 | th February 2013<br>4 | 12<br>of 105 |

Every Item above must be closely guarded. Any security breach or protective weakness is seen as an infringement of the security rules.

# **PRINCIPLES**

The principles that form the foundation of the UM ICT Security Policy that must be adhered to are as follows:

# **(a) Need-to-know access policy**

Access to the use of ICT assets is only provided for specific purposes and is limited to certain users on a need-to-know basis only. This means that access is only **provided is the function** or role of a particular user required that information. Consideration for access is given based on the information category as stated in the Security Orders document paragraph 53, page 15;

# **(b) Minimum access rights**

User minimum access rights are given at the minimum a set level that is to view and/or to read only. Authorization is necessary in order for a user to create, store, update, alter or delete any information. This access right will be reevaluated from time to time based on that roles and responsibilities of the user in question;

| DKICT UM  | Version 2.0 | th February 2013<br>4 | 13<br>of 105 |

## **(c) Accountability**

All users are responsible for all their actions as pertains to UM ICT assets. This responsibility must be expressed clearly with the appropriate level of sensitivity for every ICT source. To ensure that this responsibility is adhered to, ICT systems must be capable of supporting facilities to detect and confirm that information system users are held accountable for their actions.

Accountabilities and responsibilities of users include:

- i. Preventing exposure of information to unauthorized parties;
- ii. Checking information from time to time to ensure that it is accurate and complete;
- iii. Ensure that the information is readily usable;
- iv. Protect the confidentiality of passwords;
- v. Follow set security standards, procedures, measures and guidelines;
- vi. Pay attention to information at all stages especially during creating, processing, storage, transmission, delivery and destruction; and
- vii. Protect the secrecy of the ICT security measures from the general public.

#### **(d) Separation**

The task of creating, deleting, updating, modifying and verifying data needs to be separated in order to avoid unauthorized access as well as to protect ICT assets from errors, minor information leaks or manipulation. Separation also encompasses segregation between operations and network groups;

| DKICT UM  | Version 2.0 | th February 2013<br>4 | 14<br>of 105 |

# **(e) Auditing**

Auditing is the action of identifying incidents involving security or identifying situations that threaten security. It involves protection of all records related to security actions. Therefore, it must be ensured that ICT assets such as computers, servers, routers, firewalls and networks are capable of generating and storing security action logs or an audit trail;

# **(e) Compliance**

The UM ICT Security Policy must be read, understood and obeyed to avoid any form of violation against it that could result in threats to ICT security;

# **(f) Recovery**

System recovery is indispensable to ensure readiness and availability. The main objective is to minimize any disturbances or losses caused by unpreparedness. Recovery can be performed via backing-up and creation of a disaster/catastrophe recovery plan; and

# **(g) Mutual Dependency**

All the above principles are interrelated and mutually dependent. Therefore, varying approaches, organizing and designing as many security mechanisms as possible is necessary to ensure maximum security.

# **ICT SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT**

UM must take into account the existence of risks to ICT assets due to the proliferation of threats and vulnerabilities today. Due to that, UM needs to take the appropriate proactive steps to evaluate the level of risk to ICT assets so that the most effective solutions and decisions as pertains to the protection and control over ICT assets can be identified.

UM must execute ongoing scheduled risk assessments relating to ICT security requirements and requirement changes, and subsequently take follow-up action and/or the appropriate measures to control and minimize the ICT security risks based on the risk assessment findings.

ICT security risk assessment must be performed on all UM information systems including applications, software, servers, networks and/or processes and procedures. This risk assessment must be performed on the premises where information technology resources are located including data centers, media storage rooms, utilities and other support systems.

UM is responsible in mitigating and managing ICT security risks in line with the requirements of the General Circular Number 6 Year 2005: Public Sector Information Risk Assessment Guidelines.

UM must identify the appropriate measures to mitigate the possibility of risks existing and take the following actions:

- (a) Reduce risks by executing the appropriate control measures;
- (b) Receive and/or be prepared to face risks that may occur while fulfilling criteria that have been set by management;
- (c) Avoid and/or prevent risks that occur by taking preventative measures that avert and/or prevent the occurrence of risks; and
- (d) Transfer the risk to other parties such as suppliers, consultants and others who have interests.
