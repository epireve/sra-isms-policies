"Good Microbiological Practice" or GMP signifies the ability of the person to carry out procedures involving the handling of microorganisms in a safe manner, and minimizing risk to the

user, other persons and to the surrounding environment. GMP includes the prevention of contamination to pure cultures and the safe handling of any equipment used in practical work. The following rules must be abided by all microbiology lab users:

#### <span id="page-42-0"></span>**7.2 Safety Procedures in Microbiology Laboratories**

- 7.2.1 Unsafe behaviour, such as chewing, spitting, sucking of writing instruments, applying cosmetics, and the consumption of any food or drinks in the Microbiology Laboratories, is STRICTLY forbidden.
- 7.2.2 All students and staff must wear laboratory coats.
- 7.2.3 Long hair must be made safe by the use of a hair net, ribbon, rubber band or other suitable means.
- 7.2.4 Personal belongings, such as jackets and bags, which are brought into microbiology laboratories should be kept in designated safe area only.
- 7.2.5 The laboratory door should be closed when work is in progress.
- 7.2.6 Bench tops must be disinfected before and after use.
- 7.2.7 Mouth pipetting is forbidden in the Microbiology class or experiments; use the safety device provided.
- 7.2.8 Flaming is essential in GMP as a sound aseptic technique, such as flaming the mouth of the vessel (when the lid is removed/closed), glass pipettes, open tops of bottles and tubes, wire loops, needles, etc. Before lighting the bunsen burner, make sure there is no flammable materials nearby. The burner should be resting on a heat-resistant mat, away not directly on the plastic-covered bench top. Make sure hot loops and holders are placed on a heat-resistant mat (away from flammable materials).
- 7.2.9 Use a Biosafety Cabinet when needed to protect biological research materials and when procedures may generate biohazardous aerosols.
- 7.2.10 Personnel traffic in front of Biosafety Cabinet (BSC) should be minimized. Such movement causes air turbulence that affects the effectiveness of the BSC

airflow and may cause contaminants to be released into the work area and also contaminate the samples.

- 7.2.11 Contaminated equipment or apparatus should preferably be heat sterilised by autoclaving or by other suitable methods.
- 7.2.12 Hands must be disinfected or washed immediately when contamination is suspected, after handling infective materials, and also before leaving the laboratory.
- 7.2.13 No unauthorized users should be allowed to bring in or out from the lab any microorganisms.
- 7.2.14 Microbial stocks must be kept either in a slant position or lypholised (freeze-dried) for long-term storage. Only authorized staff can deal with microbial stocks to prevent contamination.
- 7.2.15 For short term storage, microbes can be kept on agar plates which must be kept in proper place (fridges, incubator), and old plates must be disposed by heat or moist sterilization.
- 7.2.16 Ensure that all of the objects that may come into contact with the culture, such as loops and pipette tips, are sterile before use and not contaminated by casual contact with the bench, fingers or the outside of the bottle, etc during handling. All apparatus used are to be decontaminated or disposed off in a safe manner immediately after use.
- 7.2.17 Used "sharps" (scalpel blades, syringes and needles, etc) must be disposed off into approved "sharps" containers and shall be disposed of using existing clinical/biohazard procedures. Containers must be changed regularly and not allowed to become over-full.
- 7.2.18 The waste disposal procedures for all contaminated materials must be strictly followed to ensure the disposed materials are disposed safely and do not pose as a health risk or source of infection to the public.
- 7.2.19 Another important consideration in GMP, for safety in general is the tidiness and orderliness in experimental work area. Always label tubes, bottles,

petri dishes, before the experiment begins to avoid making mistakes. Labeling of cultures to be incubated or stored, must be legible and with sufficient information. At the end of an experiment or practical class make sure you have cleared away materials and tidied up your work area. All work areas must be decontaminated immediately after use.

- 7.2.20 Personal cleanliness and hygiene is extremely important in GMP and safety. Any wounds, cuts or abrasions should be treated and dressed properly. Washing hands thoroughly in a clean basin before leaving the laboratory is mandatory.
- 7.2.21 Contagious microbes must be handled in the laboratory with appropriate BSL level, and it is mandatory to adhere to all additional procedures stipulated by these BSL labs.
- 7.2.22 All accidents should be reported to the academic supervisor and laboratory manager/person in-charge so that appropriate action can be taken to minimize the risk and likelihood of illness developing. Reporting can help the person in-charge mitigate and prevent future occurrence of such incident.

#### <span id="page-44-0"></span>**8.1 Waste Disposal**

All wastes should be properly stored and disposed following the established procedures.

#### <span id="page-44-1"></span>**8.2 Clinical Waste**

#### 8.2.1 Pipettes and petri dishes

Discard used pipettes (pointed end downwards) from microbiology studies immediately into the plastic jars with disinfectant provided. Ensure there is sufficient disinfectant in the jar (completely covering the pipettes). This disinfectant should be used for spreading over any spillages that has occurred. Used petri dishes must be discarded by placing them gently into the plastic disposal bags provided, not dropping the dishes as this leads to aerosol spreading infections. These dishes must be

made safe by autoclaving. Autoclaving is very important to ensure all pathogenic microbes are killed before disposing.

#### 8.2.2 Biological or clinical samples

All clinical and biological waste including blood, serum etc should be placed in covered, leak-proof containers or bags that are color-coded and labeled. Sharps (broken glass, needles, pipettes) which are contaminated by such waste should be placed in a closable, labeled or color-coded leak-proof, puncture resistant, disposable containers. The clinical waste will be disposed of by an authorized contractor.

#### 8.2.3 Ecological samples

Ecological samples, such as fresh fish and other aquatic fisheries samples, which are not subjected to any form of chemical treatment, can be disposed of as domestic waste. If samples were treated with preservative, such as formalin, samples should be disposed as solid chemical waste.

#### <span id="page-45-0"></span>**8.3 Animal Waste**

Research animal waste and carcasses/body parts must be disposed of as clinical waste following established procedures. NEVER dispose animal waste as general/domestic waste.

#### <span id="page-45-1"></span>**8.4 Chemical Waste**

Never dispose chemical whether solid or liquid or other hazardous materials in the general rubbish bins or pour into the sink (or down the drain). All waste must be kept in secondary containers, properly labeled and segregated according to the hazard class. Containers must be leakproof. Chemical waste should be stored in a designated location in the laboratory or in a chemical bunker. Waste disposal will be conducted periodically by authorized waste disposal contractor.

#### <span id="page-45-2"></span>**8.5 Sharp Waste**

Never dispose sharps in normal waste bins. All sharps bins must comply with BS 7320:1990 requirements. Only single use impenetrable sharps bin should be used for disposal of

sharps. The sharps bin should be yellow and have an aperture to prevent cross contamination and unintended removal of its contents. The sharps bin should be disposed of when it is 75% full.

Categories of sharps that should be handled with care are:

- i. All injection devices, including needles and syringes;
- ii. Contaminated glass such as glass slide, broken glassware, pipettes, etc;
- iii. Blades such as scalpels, razors, scissors, x-acto and other types of cutting devices.

Sharps should not be disassembled at all before disposal, i.e. separating needles from syringes. Spent syringes should not be recapped so as to prevent needle stick injuries (NSI) at workplace.

However, uncontaminated packing materials or glass shall not be disposed of into the sharps bin as this will unnecessarily increase the waste disposal cost.
