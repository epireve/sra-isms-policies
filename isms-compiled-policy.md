    *   **Secret:** Information whose unauthorized disclosure would *endanger national/University security* or cause *major damage* to interests or reputation. Requires a high level of protection.
    *   **Confidential:** Information whose unauthorized disclosure could *harm interests*, *damage reputation*, disrupt activities, cause embarrassment, or provide undue advantage to others. Requires careful protection.
    *   **Restricted:** Information not falling into the above categories but still requiring a degree of security protection due to operational or privacy considerations. Intended for internal University use.
    *   **Open / Public:** Information explicitly approved for public release or that carries no risk if disclosed. Can be shared freely.
*   **11.3 Responsibilities:**
    *   **Data Owners/Creators:** Responsible for initially classifying information they create or manage, in consultation with guidelines and relevant authorities (e.g., Head of Department, Registrar's Office, Bursar's Office).
    *   **All Users:** Responsible for identifying the classification of information they handle and applying the appropriate security measures throughout its lifecycle (creation, storage, processing, transmission, disposal).
*   **11.4 Handling Procedures Based on Classification:**
    *   **Access:** Access to classified information (Restricted and above) is restricted based on the "Need-to-Know" principle and requires appropriate authorization. Users handling Secret or Top Secret information may require security vetting.
    *   **Labeling:** Physical documents and digital files containing classified information should be appropriately marked with their classification level where feasible.
    *   **Storage:**
        *   *Physical:* Classified documents must be stored securely (e.g., locked cabinets, secure rooms). Apply "Clear Desk" policy.
        *   *Digital:* Classified electronic information requires storage in secure, access-controlled environments (e.g., designated UM servers, encrypted drives). Storage on personal devices or unapproved public cloud services is PROHIBITED for Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret data, and requires specific approval for Restricted data (See Chapters 12 & 13).
    *   **Transmission:** Transmitting classified information electronically (email, file transfer) MUST use University-approved encryption methods. Physical transfer must follow secure procedures.
    *   **Discussion:** Discussions involving classified information should occur in secure environments where unauthorized individuals cannot overhear.
    *   **Disposal:** Classified information, whether physical or digital, MUST be destroyed using secure methods that render it irrecoverable (e.g., cross-cut shredding, degaussing, physical destruction of media) according to University disposal procedures (See Chapter 21).
*   **11.5 Personal Data:** Information classified as personal data under the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) must be handled with appropriate care, equivalent to at least 'Restricted' or 'Confidential' depending on context, ensuring compliance with PDPA principles.

**Chapter 12: Malware and Hazardous Software Protection**

    *   **Supervisor/Department:** Inform your immediate supervisor or Head of Department about the incident.
    *   **Lost/Stolen Devices:** Also report immediately to the **UM Security Office** (03-7967 7070 / 3582).
*   **24.4 What to Report:** Provide as much detail as possible, including:
    *   Your name and contact information.
    *   Date and time the incident occurred or was discovered.
    *   Location (physical location, system name, IP address, URL).
    *   Description of the incident (what happened, what was observed).
    *   Any systems, data, or individuals potentially affected.
    *   Any actions already taken.
*   **24.5 Incident Response Process:** Once reported, UMCERT and/or JTM/PTM will initiate an investigation and response process. This may involve analyzing logs, examining affected systems, containing the threat, eradicating malware, restoring systems/data, and implementing preventative measures. Users MUST cooperate fully with this process. (See Appendix C for overview).
*   **24.6 Preservation of Evidence:** Do not attempt to delete logs, reformat systems, or take actions that could destroy evidence related to a security incident unless specifically instructed by UMCERT or JTM/PTM.

**Chapter 25: Monitoring, Auditing, and Investigations**

*(Based on RR-PTM-001, DKICT Ver 2.0, Declarations)*

To maintain security and ensure compliance, the University monitors and may audit ICT resources and activities.

*   **25.1 System and Network Monitoring:** Users must be aware that the University monitors its ICT infrastructure (networks, servers, systems) for various purposes, including:
    *   Detecting and responding to security threats and incidents.
    *   Ensuring operational performance and availability.
    *   Troubleshooting technical problems.
    *   Capacity planning.
    *   Ensuring compliance with University policies.
    *   Monitoring may involve automated tools analyzing traffic patterns, system logs (recording access times, usernames, IP addresses, actions taken), and network flows.
*   **25.2 Auditing:** The University reserves the right to conduct periodic audits of systems, applications, and network usage to verify compliance with policies, security standards, and licensing agreements. This may include vulnerability scanning or checks for unauthorized software or devices.
*   **25.3 Investigations:**
    *   If a potential policy violation or security incident occurs, the University may conduct an investigation.
    *   During an investigation, authorized personnel (e.g., UMCERT, JTM/PTM management, Internal Audit, Legal Office) may need to access user accounts, logs, emails, or data stored on University systems relevant to the investigation.
    *   In specific cases, data on University-owned or personal devices connected to the network may need to be examined or copied securely for forensic analysis, following established procedures and respecting user rights where applicable.
    *   Users are required to cooperate fully with authorized investigations.
*   **25.4 Privacy Considerations:** While monitoring and investigations are necessary, the University aims to respect user privacy. Access to user content (like email content) during investigations is typically restricted, requires appropriate authorization levels, and is limited to what is necessary for the specific investigation, in accordance with University policies and applicable laws.

**Chapter 26: Compliance with Laws and Regulations**

*(Based on DKICT Ver 2.0, PGHB2022)*

The use of University ICT resources must comply with both internal policies and external legal and regulatory frameworks.

    *   **Copyright Act 1987 (and amendments):** Protects intellectual property; prohibits unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted materials (software, music, videos, text).
    *   **Official Secrets Act 1972:** Governs the handling and protection of classified government/official information.
    *   **Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA):** Regulates the processing of personal data in commercial transactions (and influences University best practices for handling all personal data).
    *   **Digital Signature Act 1997:** Provides legal framework for digital signatures.
    *   **Sedition Act 1948 / Penal Code:** Relevant sections may apply to prohibited content (e.g., inciting hatred, defamation).
*   **26.3 University Acts and Statutes:** Use of ICT resources must also comply with the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971, the Constitution of the Universiti Malaya, and associated statutes and regulations, including disciplinary rules for staff and students.
*   **26.4 Professional and Ethical Standards:** Users are expected to conduct themselves according to high ethical standards and any professional codes relevant to their discipline when using University ICT resources.

**Chapter 27: Policy Violations and Consequences**

*(Based on multiple policies, including RR-PTM-001, Public Cloud Policy, DKICT)*

Failure to comply with the policies outlined in this handbook can have serious consequences for the individual user and the University.

*   **27.1 Nature of Violations:** A policy violation occurs when a user fails to adhere to any rule, regulation, guideline, or requirement stated in this Handbook or other official UM ICT policies. Violations can range from unintentional mistakes to deliberate misuse or malicious acts.
*   **27.2 Potential Consequences:** Depending on the severity, intent, and impact of the violation, the University may take one or more of the following actions:
    *   **Informal/Formal Warning:** A verbal or written warning from a supervisor, Head of Department, or JTM/PTM.
    *   **Mandatory Training:** Requirement to attend additional security awareness or policy training.
    *   **Access Restriction/Suspension:** Temporary or permanent suspension of access privileges to specific ICT resources (e.g., wireless network, a particular system) or all University ICT resources (including email and network access).
    *   **Disciplinary Action:** Formal disciplinary proceedings under the relevant University regulations for staff (e.g., *Universiti Malaya (Tataterbit Staf)*) or students (e.g., *Kaedah-Kaedah Universiti Malaya (Tatatertib Pelajar-Pelajar) 1997*). Penalties can range from reprimands to suspension or dismissal/expulsion.
    *   **Cost Recovery:** Requiring the user to bear the costs associated with investigating and remediating damage caused by the violation.
    *   **Legal Action:** Reporting the violation to law enforcement agencies if it involves potential criminal activity (e.g., hacking, fraud, distribution of illegal content). The user may face prosecution under Malaysian law.
    *   **Civil Liability:** Users may be held personally liable for damages or claims brought by third parties resulting from their actions that violated policy or law (e.g., copyright infringement, data breach caused by negligence).
*   **27.3 Reporting Violations:** Users who become aware of potential policy violations by others are encouraged to report their concerns responsibly to their supervisor, Head of Department, JTM/PTM, or UMCERT.
