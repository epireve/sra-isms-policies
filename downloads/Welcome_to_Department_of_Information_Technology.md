#### ICT Security Notices

| Notice | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Scam Alerts | **FRAUDULENT Employment offer letter from University Of Malaya,Malaysia.**  **NOTICE 1: Job Recruitment Fraud**  **University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (UM)** has been made aware of the unauthorised use of the name of the University of Malaya by irresponsible**unauthorised party / parties** with the following details:   1. **FALSELY** using the university name in emails "**From: Zara Recruitment : careers.zararecruitment@gmail.com**" **and OZONE RECRUITMENT MALAYSIA [career.ozonerecruitment@gmail.com](mailto:career.ozonerecruitment@gmail.com)** with the **subject of “Employment offer latter from University Of Malaya,Malaysia**” 2. **ATTEMPT** to recruit on behalf of UM and solicit up-front fees on the pretense of obtaining immigration documents including visa or work permit from interested job-seekers.   **University of Malaya (UM)** strongly **DENY** that it has authorised the sending of such e-mail.  **University of Malaya (UM)** hereby appeals to the public **NOT to respond** to the e-mail or any such e-mails.  **How to recognise** whether you have received **FRAUD/ SCAM email** :   1. University of Malaya, official website pages always include [https://www.um.edu.my](https://www.um.edu.my/). Any other URLs are fake. 2. Applications for employment are done via our online portal - [https://e-recruitment.um.edu.my](https://e-recruitment.um.edu.my/) and via a manual form available on <https://um.edu.my/about-um/career> 3. Email communication on recruitment from University of Malaya, if any, would be sent by our officials using only e-mail domains of **@um.edu.my**. Any recruiter or company that corresponds from a free email account such as Yahoo, Live,  Hotmail or Gmail is very likely a scammer. Legitimate job related emails will come from corporate email accounts. 4. University of Malaya has **NEVER** appointed any third party agencies to represent the University in recruitment exercises or to process work/residence permits/-visas.   Should you receive such email, please treat the communication as fraudulent ; mark the email as SPAM and forward it to: [**umcert@um.edu.my**](mailto:umcert@um.edu.my)    **NOTICE OF DISCLAIMER**  University of Malaya hereby shall not be responsible and liable to any parties whether directly or indirectly, who have for any losses, cost, claim, liability, expense, demand or damages whatsoever (including any loss of profit, loss of saving or incidental or consequential damages), arising from any unauthorised, misrepresentation or fraudulent Job Offer Letter which falsely using University of Malaya’s name, logo, crest or emblem by any irresponsible parties. University of Malaya reserves the right to take legal action, including criminal action, against such individuals/entities. |
| Awareness Alerts | **Is It Safe to Save Passwords on Your Computer?**  **These are the top 4 reasons why you shouldn’t store passwords in your Web browser**   1. **Lost Devices**:     If you ever lose your laptop, cellphone, or tablet, anyone that picks it up could have access to your online passwords. And that means they can quickly and easily log into your bank accounts or any other website where you’ve used your browser for password storage.  2. **Remote Hacking:**     Hackers have been known to use viruses and other malware to gain remote access to your computer via the Internet. If that ever happens to you, there’s a very good chance that the cybercriminal will head straight for your passwords to steal as much important data from you as possible.  3. **Sneaky Snoopers:**     If you’re serious about your privacy and don’t want your personal info to be available to roommates, family members, or nosy visitors, leaving your device laying around should be avoided at all costs. This is especially true if you store your passwords online!  4. **Forgotten Credentials:**     Although this isn’t a safety concern, if you use your browser to store your passwords, and you happen to lose access to that browser, you’ll have to deal with changing all of your login credentials to every website you regularly use. That does not sound like fun to us.   *Source:-https://www.findreviews.com/is-it-safe-to-save-passwords-on-your-computer* |
